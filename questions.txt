1.Your React application is rendering a page very slowly. How are you going to investigate and/or fix the issue?

=> The way i would go if a react app is rendering a page slowly is:

a.first check if any page is re-rendering a lot of times
b.check if any functions or requests are running abnormally
c.try to lazy load only the required resources up front
d.remove any code redundency
e.try to optimize code

2.What is the difference between filter and map

=> map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually. 
filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong.

example:-

for filter:-
const ages = [32, 33, 16, 4];
const result = ages.filter(checkAdult);

function checkAdult(age) {
  return age >= 18;
}
here the output is 32,33


for map:-

const numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4];
const newArr = numbers.map(myFunction)

function myFunction(num) {
  return num * 10;
}

here output is 650,440,120,40

4.What technical aspects of React do you struggle with?

up until now, i have  learned fundamental concepts of react. There is still a lot to
learn for me. I do not have any problems with basic concepts such as Router, Basic Hooks,
state, lifeCycle , Components , basic redux including the concepts used in this application.
So for now, i would have to say the aspects i struggle with react are the more advanced topics
of react that i have not learned yet.
